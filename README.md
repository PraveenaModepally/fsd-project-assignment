Here we have created a website for merge sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows divide and conquer approach .Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Merge sort continuously cuts down a list into multiple sublists until each has only one item, then merges those sublists into a sorted list.
